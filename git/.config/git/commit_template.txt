# Guidelines:
#
# <type>[optional scope]: <description>
# 
# [optional body]
# 
# [optional footer(s)]
# 
# -----
# 
# - Separate subject from body with a blank line
# - Limit the subject line to 50 characters
# - Use all lowercase for the subject line
#   (Conventional Commits convention)
# - Do not end the subject line with a period
# - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
# - Wrap the body at 72 characters
# - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
# - Use a hanging indent
#
# > The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate
# > intent to the consumers of your library:
# > 
# > 1. fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this
# >    correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
# > 2. feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the
# >    codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
# > 3. BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or
# >    appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API
# >    change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A
# >    BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
# > 4. types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example
# >    @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention)
# >    recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:,
# >    test:, and others.
# > 5. footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided
# >    and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.
# >
# > Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits
# > specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning
# > (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). A scope may be provided to
# > a commitâ€™s type, to provide additional contextual information and is
# > contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to
# > parse arrays.
